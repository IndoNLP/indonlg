⚠️ Update 16/11/2024: We update the links to the datasets and fasttext models in IndoNLG!

<b>IndoNLG</b> is a collection of Natural Language Generation (NLG) resources for Bahasa Indonesia with 6 kind of downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce the results and large pre-trained models (<b>IndoBART</b> and <b>IndoGPT</b>) trained with around 4 billion word corpus (<b>Indo4B-Plus</b>), around ~25 GB of text data. This project was initially started by a joint collaboration between universities and industry, such as Institut Teknologi Bandung, Universitas Multimedia Nusantara, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Universitas Indonesia, DeepMind, Gojek, and Prosa.AI.

## Research Paper
IndoNLG has been accepted by EMNLP 2021 and you can find the details in our paper https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.699.
